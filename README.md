### Vision

Present a website that will verify the user's age to check if they are entitled to claim Universal Credit and redirect them to new pages with the appropriate results. 📅 🔍

1️⃣8️⃣⬆️ Users over 18, will be redirected to a page, which confirms their eligibility. 

1️⃣8️⃣⬇️ Users under 18, will be redirected to a page, which disproves their eligibility.

### User Stories
- [x] As a support seeker user, I’d like to fill out a form to verify if I’m entitled to claim Universal Credit considering my age, so I can start my application #1
- [x] As a user who needs reassurance, I’d like to get visual feedback if I’m entitled so I can make sure before I submit my application #2
- [x] As a user who needs reassurance, I’d like to get visual feedback if I’m not entitled so I can start looking for other options #3
- [ ] As a visually impaired user, I want to use keyboard controls so I can navigate the website and activate elements on the page #4
- [ ] As a visually impaired user, I want to hear my screen reader describe the content on the website so I can get information about the type of elements on the page #5

### Guideline to test the solution on the UI

❌ To be redirected to a page, which shows non-eligibility, give a date before 2004
